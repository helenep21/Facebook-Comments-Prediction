## The dataset 

Our dataset was the [Facebook Comment Volume Prediction](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+Comment+Volume+Dataset). 

Since several years, social networking services use has highly increased. This dataset fit in the  need to understand the behavior of users on those services. In 2016, Facebook was the most active social network with 1.76 billion users. 

Thus, the **goal** is to predict the number of comments in the next H hours (H being a feature of the dataset).

## The content
- One notebook containing the data exploration, as well as the training of the models
- files concerning the flask API
